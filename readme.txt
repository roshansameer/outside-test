Outside is a test project. This plugin register "Event" Custom Post Type and "Event Types" taxonomy.

You can use [outside /] shortcode to display the Events with 'event_type' and 'limit' attributes. ( e.g [ outside event_type=webinar limit=10 ] ).

I have created the custom API endpoint 'outside-events'. You can view this endpoint by https://yoursite.com/?outside-events

Also I have created a Gutenberg block named 'Event Slider' which renders the Slick Slider on Frontend.

For filter I have created a shortcode '[outside_filter_event/]' which will filter the posts.
